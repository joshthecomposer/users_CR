# Users CR
Create a Flask app that can connect to a database. Also display and create from/into the database.
### Objectives:
* Create 2 html pages, Read (All) and Create
* Display all users from the database on the Read (All) page
* Display form to create new users on the Create page
* When the form is submitted, a new user should be inserted into the database
* Redirect to Read (All) page after creating a new user, and the user just created should appear in the table
